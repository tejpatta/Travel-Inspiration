# Travel-Inspiration (Yūgen)

## Description 

This project is structured in building a website application called Yūgen which will be showing off stunning locations, tourist sites and travel advice to inspire travellers. Users can read about fascinating sights, explore different areas, and make plans for their next adventure. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML, CSS and Javascript powered by jQuery.

Furthermore, this website is a front-end interactive webpage which reacts completely to user input. It enables the user to access information and photos for different countries, storing their favourites on a seperate page to view at a later date. There is also a random country generator activated by simply clicking the search button without entering a country name.

The page architecture is made up of the following :

* Bootstrap
* Navigation Bar.
* Inviting Cover Image with Call To Action Button.
* Country Information Section.
* Carousel
* Cards and Footers
* Unsplash
* Jumbotron

The user is presented with four different information sources after choosing a country (Country Information, 3 Top Cities, Recent Tourism Articles and Pictures of the Cities). Futhermore, there is a place holder in the search button that will be a lucky draw. This allows users to search, without having to input a country, which will then generate random countries by clicking the search button.

* Finding Activities: This section permits the users to discover what the destination has to offer. After typing in the destination country, the search button popup the attractions after countries are being searched. Then you can find activities on the current cities within the search.
